**The Gimbal Rig Mercury** is a 2nd-year Unity game developed solo within a 1-month exercise on the theme of **Rotation**. 

The objective is to stabilize an out-of-control gimbal rig used by an astronaut. Players must counteract random accelerations, as excessive rotation can cause the astronaut to pass out.
